## Description
As a social media startup, I want an api for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. Using mongoDB as a database will allow  me to do just that. I built this project to test my knowledge of using NoSQL databases and storing to them. During this project I learned how to build schemas for a NoSQL database as well as get everything connected to each other so data is being saved to the database.

## Installation
This respoitory can be cloned. You will need mongoDB installed locally and insomnia to test the routes.

## Usage
After installing, the user would open the integrated terminal from index.js in the root and 'npm run seed' and then 'npm start'. Please watch the video linked below to learn how to test the routes:
